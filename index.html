    <p>This page is just a simple webpage that is built for learning purpose.</p>
    
    <h2>What is CI/CD?</h2>
    <p>Continuous integration is the practice of regularly integrating (merging) code with the rest of the organization. It used to be common for individuals or teams to keep their code isolated in branches for many months and merge infrequently. Continuous delivery is a philosophy and set of practices around always keeping your application in a deployable state. In order to achieve this we construct a deployment pipeline that serves to validate the correctness of changes, and deliver those changes through a series of test environments, culminating in a production deploy. CI/CD together is the practice of merging changes frequently as devs work and having those changes pass through a series of automated tests. Upon completion those changes are bundled into a release candidate that can then be deployed automatically into production.</p>
